\begin{lesson}{Calculating Volumes by slicing}
  To calculate the area under the curve, we \emph{slice} the region under the curve into tiny rectangles and take the limit. The \emph{idea of slicing} can be adapted to calculate the volume of a solid.

    Let \(S\) be a solid that lies between \(x=a\) and \(x=b\). If \(A(x)\) is the \emph{cross-sectional area} of \(S\) in the plane \(P_{x}\), through \(x\) and perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis, 
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:volume}
      (\text{volume of } S) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} A(x_{i}^{*}) \Delta x = \int_{a}^{b} A(x) \;dx.
    \end{equation}

    The so-called disk method (textbook page 645) and washer method (textbook page 648) are special cases of Equation~\eqref{eq:volume}.

  % use the word "measure"

  \begin{example}
    Set up, but do not evaluate, a definite integral representing the volume of sphere centred at the origin with radius \(1\). \\

  A \emph{solid of revolution} is obtained by rotating a region in a plane about a line in space. \\
  {\footnotesize Explore \url{https://www.geogebra.org/m/th54w7h9} (GeoGebra).}


  The cross-section (perpendicular to the line of rotation) of a solid of revolution is either a \emph{disk} or a \emph{washer}.

  \begin{example}
    Suppose a solid of revolution \(S\) is obtained by rotating the finite region enclosed between \(y = x^{2}\) and \(y = x\) about the \(x\)-axis. Find the volume of \(S\).
    % poll which is the outer curve, and which is the inner curve?

    % we need to measure the cross-sectional area.
    % talk about the meaing of the limits of integration.
    % look for a verticle slice
