\begin{lesson}{Derivative of exponential and logarithms}
  We have already done all the hard work in implicit differentiation.  This section is simply a summary of the derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions. 

  The derivation of \(\frac{d}{dx} e^{x} = e^{x}\) depends on the ``magic limit'' \(\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{b^{h} - 1}{h} = \ln(b)\) for any \(b > 0\) and \(b \ne 1\). The rest is a routine calculation starting from the (limit) definition of derivatives. 

  \begin{example}
    Assume \(b > 0\) and \(b \ne 1\). Find the derivative of \(y = b^{x}\) by changing the base to \(e\).

  \begin{example}
    Find \(\frac{d}{dx}\ln(x)\) by implicitly differentiating its equivalent equation \(x = e^{y}\).
