\faComments{} Suppose you go to Montreal for a day trip. If your thermometer at home reads \(5^{\circ}\)C at \(7 \text{ am}\) and \({10}^{\circ}\)C at \(5\text{ pm}\), does the thermometer \underline{have to} read \({8}^{\circ}\)C \emph{sometime} between 7 am and 5 pm?

Imagine and draw the graph of a temperature function \(H(t)\) that fits the given scenario. Compare graphs with your neighbours. Use your graph to support your conclusion.

What \underline{mathematical property} of the temperature function \(H(t)\) \emph{guides} you to think this way?

Can you tell \underline{exactly} when (down to seconds) the temperature reached \(8^{\circ}\)C?

\begin{mdframed}[style=withref]
  Let \(f\) be a \underline{\hspace{1in}} function over a closed, bounded interval \([a,b]\). If \(z\) is any real number between \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\), then \underline{\hspace{1in}} a number \(c\) in \([a,b]\) satisfying \(f(c) = z\).

When is IVT useful? You wish to 
\blanklines{2} % solve an equation \(f(z) = c\)
\large\hlwarn{BUT}
\blanklines{3} % don't care exactly what \(z\) is

How do we use IVT? We must successfully complete all three tasks: 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(IVT \arabic*)]
  \item Find, guess, or be given {a \emph{closed and bounded} interval \([a,b]\)}
  \item Verify {\(f\) is continuous on \([a,b]\)}
  \item Verify {\(z\) is between \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\)}
\end{enumerate}
If we cannot complete one or more of these tasks, then IVT \hlwarn{does not apply}.

\begin{example}
  Show the function \(f(t) = t^{5} - t^{2} + 1\) has a root between \(-1\) and \(1\).
\end{example}
